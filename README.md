# Smart-Grocer
> Created an App that calculates the prices of groceries(low, high, average)

***To Run:*** Please have Python installed on your device and use the python shell to call the file from the directory. A text GUI will then greet you and you can enter any grocery item. Make sure the ***prices.txt*** is included in the same directory as the program!
